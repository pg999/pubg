    "\n",
    "DBNOs - Number of enemy players knocked.\n",
    "assists - Number of enemy players this player damaged that were killed by teammates.\n",
    "boosts - Number of boost items used.\n",
    "damageDealt - Total damage dealt. Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n",
    "headshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n",
    "heal - Number of healing items used.\n",
    "killPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n",
    "killPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.)\n",
    "killStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n",
    "kills - Number of enemy players killed.\n",
    "longestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n",
    "matchId - Integer ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n",
    "revives - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n",
    "rideDistance - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n",
    "roadKills - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n",
    "swimDistance - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n",
    "teamKills - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n",
    "vehicleDestroys - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n",
    "walkDistance - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n",
    "weaponsAcquired - Number of weapons picked up.\n",
    "winPoints - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.)\n",
    "groupId - Integer ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n",
    "numGroups - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n",
    "maxPlace - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n",
    "winPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match."
